TCP/IP

TCP (or Transmission Control Protocol for short) is another one of these rules used in networking.



This protocol is very similar to the OSI model that we have previously discussed in room three of this module so far. The TCP/IP protocol consists of four layers and is arguably just a summarised version of the OSI model. These layers are:

Application
Transport
Internet
Network Interface


Very similar to how the OSI model works, information is added to each layer of the TCP model as the piece of data (or packet) traverses it. As you may recall, this process is known as encapsulation - where the reverse of this process is decapsulation.



One defining feature of TCP is that it is connection-based, which means that TCP must establish a connection between both a client and a device acting as a server before data is sent.


TCP packets contain various sections of information known as headers that are added from encapsulation. Let's explain some of the crucial headers in the table below:



Header	                              Description

Source Port                     	This value is the port opened by the sender to send the TCP packet from. This value is chosen randomly (out of the ports from 0-65535 that aren't already in use at the time).

Destination Port                	This value is the port number that an application or service is running on the remote host (the one receiving data); for example, a webserver running on port 80. Unlike the source port, this value is not chosen at random.

Source IP	                        This is the IP address of the device that is sending the packet.

Destination IP	                  This is the IP address of the device that the packet is destined for.

Sequence Number                 	When a connection occurs, the first piece of data transmitted is given a random number. We'll explain this more in-depth further on.

Acknowledgement Number	          After a piece of data has been given a sequence number, the number for the next piece of data will have the sequence number + 1. We'll also explain this more in-depth further on.

Checksum	                        This value is what gives TCP integrity. A mathematical calculation is made where the output is remembered. When the receiving device performs the mathematical calculation, the data must be corrupt if the output is different from what was sent.

Data	                            This header is where the data, i.e. bytes of a file that is being transmitted, is stored.

Flag	                            This header determines how the packet should be handled by either device during the handshake process. Specific flags will determine specific behaviours, which is what we'll come on to explain below.




Next, we'll come on to discuss the Three-way handshake - the term given for the process used to establish a connection between two devices. The Three-way handshake communicates using a few special messages - the table below highlights the main ones:



Step	                      Message	              Description
1	                           SYN	                  A SYN message is the initial packet sent by a client during the handshake. This packet is used to initiate a connection and synchronise the two devices together (we'll explain this further later on).

2                            SYN/ACK	              This packet is sent by the receiving device (server) to acknowledge the synchronisation attempt from the client.

3	                           ACK	                  The acknowledgement packet can be used by either the client or server to acknowledge that a series of messages/packets have been successfully received.

4	                           DATA	                  Once a connection has been established, data (such as bytes of a file) is sent via the "DATA" message.

5	                           FIN	                  This packet is used to cleanly (properly) close the connection after it has been complete.

#	                           RST	                  This packet abruptly ends all communication. This is the last resort and indicates there was some problem during the process. For example, if the service or application is not working correctly, or the system has faults such as low resources. 



Any sent data is given a random number sequence and is reconstructed using this number sequence and incrementing by 1. Both computers must agree on the same number sequence for data to be sent in the correct order. This order is agreed upon during three steps:

SYN - Client: Here's my Initial Sequence Number(ISN) to SYNchronise with (0)

SYN/ACK - Server: Here's my Initial Sequence Number (ISN) to SYNchronise with (5,000), and I ACKnowledge your initial number sequence (0)

ACK - Client: I ACKnowledge your Initial Sequence Number (ISN) of (5,000), here is some data that is my ISN+1 (0 + 1)



Device                       Initial Number Sequence (ISN)	                 Final Number Sequence	

Client (Sender)	                0	                                               0 + 1 = 1

Client (Sender)	                1                                           	   1 + 1 = 2	

Client (Sender)	                2	                                               2 + 1 = 3



TCP Closing a Connection:

Let's quickly explain the process behind TCP closing a connection. First, TCP will close a connection once a device has determined that the other device has successfully received all of the data.

Because TCP reserves system resources on a device, it is best practice to close TCP connections as soon as possible.

To initiate the closure of a TCP connection, the device will send a "FIN" packet to the other device. Of course, with TCP, the other device will also have to acknowledge this packet.
